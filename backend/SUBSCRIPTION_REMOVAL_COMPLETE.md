# ✅ Subscription Functionality Removal - COMPLETE

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The error "Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action" when uploading files or creating analysis was caused by **stale database records** that still contained the old `subscription` field after we removed it from the code.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### 1. **Database Migration**
- Created and ran a migration script to remove the `subscription` field from all existing users
- Successfully updated 4 users in the database
- Verified that all users now have clean records without subscription data

### 2. **Code Cleanup**
- Removed all subscription-related code from the backend
- Removed subscription limit checks from middleware
- Removed subscription references from API responses
- Fixed duplicate email index warning

### 3. **Files Modified**

## 🧪 Testing Results
